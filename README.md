## 🔎 Overview
Fraudulent transactions are rare but extremely costly.  
This project applies **machine learning techniques** to detect fraud while addressing dataset imbalance, feature engineering, and evaluation challenges.  

**Key goals:**
- Preprocess and balance highly imbalanced datasets.
- Train classical ML models and evaluate performance.
- Compare models using robust metrics (Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC, F1).
- Provide clean, reproducible code structure for future extension.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- Transactions: **284,807**  
- Fraud cases: **492 (~0.17%)**  
- Features: 30 anonymized numerical variables + `Class` label
